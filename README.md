Implementing a simple ray tracer in Swift.

### Sample.

### Progress.
- Development of the  ray tracer is following Peter Shirley's Ray Tracing series.
- 'Ray Tracing in One Weekend' is implemented with the exception of defocus blur, I'm not so interested in mimicking a camera lens.
- Currently working on 'The Next Week'.
- Support for sphere primitives.
- Materials include lambertians, metals, and dielectrics.
